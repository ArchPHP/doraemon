## the ArchPHP Loong/Doraemon project
 - Apparently, Doraemon is the robotic cat, who has lots of magic tools.
 - The PHP community needs such a cat desperately.
 - We hope our peer PHP developers would enjoy the tools this cat provides.
 - The `ArchPHP` namespace has been taken and we have no choice but to use anther namespace. And we choose `Loong` which is a kind of mythical creatures of great powers. And we admire them.
